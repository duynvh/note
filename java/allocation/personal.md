# Reading notes:
- Call Stack
    + Stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computergram
    + FIFO Last In First Out
- Memory Stack
    + Stack Memory in Java is used for static memory allocation and the execution of a thread LIFO - Last In First Out
- Frame
    + A stack frame contains all the data for one function call
    + The stack grame only exists during the execution time of a function including any refrences
- Heap
    + Space is used to store object and JRE classes at runtime
    + New objects always created in heap space
    + Refrences to these objects are stored in stack memory
